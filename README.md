# Image-Compression-Using-Vectorization

We'll be trying to compress an image using VQ. Vector quantization (VQ) is a lossy data compression method based on the principle of block coding. It is a fixed-to-fixed length algorithm.

## How to run ? 
    1. Clone/Download the repo
    2. Open a terminal in the cloned repo's directory 
    3. Run jupyter notebook
    4. Open ImageCompression.ipynb
